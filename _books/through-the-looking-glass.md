The sequel to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1871. This time, Alice steps through a mirror into an alternate world where everything is reversed, and the landscape is laid out like a giant chessboard.

Alice encounters new eccentric characters, including Humpty Dumpty, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and the Red Queen. The story incorporates themes of logic, paradoxes, and wordplay, mirroring a game of chess.
