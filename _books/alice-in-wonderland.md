Originally published in 1865, this classic novel by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) tells the story of Alice, a young girl who falls through a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, often humorously, making it popular with adults as well as children. Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.

Key characters include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, and the formidable Queen of Hearts.
